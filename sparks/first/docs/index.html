            <h1>first Spark Documentation</h1>
            <h2><a name="overview"></a>Overview / Highlights</h2>
            <p>This spark is meant to provide a foundation for a single-page AngularJS application where a user's access to particular
            views and navigation options are determined by his/her user roles.  It includes Twitter Bootstrap to provide the styles and power and navigation bar
            and utilizes the core Angular router (ng-route).</p>
            <p>Some of the other notable features:</p>
            <ul id="overviewList">
                <li>Built on <a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">AngularJS 1.3.x</a></li>
                <li>Incorporates the <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngAria" target="_blank">ngAria module</a> (compatible with Angular 1.3x and higher) to automatically add ARIA
                    accessibility attributes in certain scenarios.</li>
                <li>Uses the "controller as" syntax to bind controllers and views without utilizing $scope.</li>
                <li>Provides boilerplate code for making the REST calls to the server for authenticating the user and requesting data about the user and their roles
                from the server.</li>
                <li>Uses HTTP interceptors to ensure REST data requests are not cached by the browser and to handle certain error conditions.</li>
                <li>Controls user access to different application views by comparing the user's roles against the specified route based on a route naming convention.</li>
                <li>The demo codebase demonstrates how to use the <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngMockE2E" target="_blank">ngMockE2E</a> module, $httpBackend requests, and mock data to mock
                    REST responses and simulate an operational application.</li>
                <li>Provides <a href="http://jasmine.github.io/1.3/introduction.html" target="_blank">Jasmine</a>-based unit tests run with <a
                        href="http://karma-runner.github.io/0.12/index.html" target="_blank">Karma</a>, and end-to-end tests written with
                    <a href="http://angular.github.io/protractor/#/" target="_blank">Protractor</a>. The Protractor tests demonstrate a technique for running certain sets of
                        tests based on user role.</li>
                <li>Provides <a href="http://gruntjs.com/" target="_blank">Grunt</a> commands for:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Executing unit tests and the various Protractor test suites from the command line.</li>
                        <li>Creating skeleton files for new Angular controllers, services, directives, and unit and Protractor test files.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>This spark provides two codebases:  the "template" codebase meant to be the clean starting point for a new Angular-based application, and
            the "demo" codebase that provides a working example of an application based on the spark.</p>

            <h2><a name="configuration"></a>Configuration Steps</h2>

            <p>The web applications in the "template" and "demo" codebases will work without any sort of configuration. The "template"
            codebase includes some "TODO" comments pointing out areas that require configuration if you want to utilize certain features
            as you build on top of the codebase.</p>

            <p>If you want to run the unit tests in either codebase, you will need to make sure <a
                    href="http://karma-runner.github.io/0.12/index.html" target="_blank">Karma</a> is installed on your machine:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Open a command prompt and run the command <em>npm install -g karma-cli</em>.</li>
                </ul>
            <p>Note that Karma is configured to use Chrome
            to help execute the tests:  you can change that in the configuration file in testing/config/karma.conf.js.</p>

            <p>If you want to run the Protractor tests in either codebase, you will need to have <a href="http://angular.github.io/protractor/#/" target="_blank">Protractor</a> installed on your machine:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Open a command prompt and run the command <em>npm install -g protractor</em></li>
                    <li>Then run the command <em>webdriver-manager update</em> to install the needed binaries.</li>
                </ul>
            <p>You will also need to change the local URL
            for the app in the testing/e2e/helpers/PrepareObject.js file in each codebase (or in the Sparker "testing" folder after the spark is loaded) to point to the web address
            of this instance of Sparker.</p>

            <p>The 3rd-party resources used (Bootstrap, AngularJS, etc) located in the packages folder were originally installed with <a href="http://bower.io/">Bower</a>.
                The Bower.json file that tracks the packages is present in the app folder if you want to use install and use Bower to maintain those libraries.</p>

            <h2><a name="userroles"></a>User Roles and Route Access</h2>

            <p>When there are certain views and functions in your application that are only meant to be accessed by certain users, the usual approach to prevent unauthorized
            users from accessing those areas is to hide the navigation elements that lead to those areas, and/or to add code to the controller for that view that checks
            the user's credentials.  The drawback with the latter approach is that you have to remember to add that credential check to every relevant controller.</p>

            <p>This spark uses a technique in which the user's ability to access a route is determined by his or her user roles and the structure of the URL route,
            and the authorization check occurs on a route change, without the need to add code to any of the relevant controllers.</p>

            <p>To make use of this feature, simply do the following:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Populate the authRoles constant in the app.js file that serves as the Angular root module for the application with the names of all of the user roles
                the application needs to support.</li>
                <li>Make sure that the service functions that perform the user login (performLogin) and retrieve the user token from the server (requestUser)
                populate the $rootScope.session.user object with a "roles" property containing an array of the user's roles.</li>
                <li>Make sure you have "/login" and "/unauthorized" routes to redirect users when they cannot access a route based on their
                    authentication status or permissions.</li>
                <li>Write your $routeProvider roles based on the following conventions:
                    <ul>
                        <li>If the route is meant to be accessible to any authenticated user, regardless of role, start the route URL with "/auth" followed by
                        the unique name of the route (example:  "/auth/updateProfile").</li>
                        <li>If the route is only accessible to a user with a particular user role, start the route URL with "/auth" followed by the name of the
                        role and then the unique name of the route (example: "/auth/admin/manageUsers").</li>
                        <li>If the route is accessible to multiple roles, start the route URL with "/auth" followed by
                            the unique name of the route, then add logic to the route controller to verify that the user has one of the necessary roles.</li>
                        <li>If the route can be accessed by unauthenticated users/prior to login, do not include "/auth" or any user roles in the route URL.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>All of the relevant code that enforces these routing conventions lives in the run() method of the app.js file.  Look at that file in the demo codebase
                (code/demo/app/common/app.js) to see an implementation example.</p>

            <h2><a name="interceptors"></a>The HTTP Interceptors</h2>

            <p>The app/services/interceptorService.js file defines HTTP interceptor functions used in the application and adds them to the $httpProvider
            interceptors array.  These interceptors:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Add a timestamp value to any GET request designed to retrieve data (as opposed to an HTML file), preventing browsers from serving up
                stale, cached results of previous calls to the same URL.</li>
                <li>Redirect users to the "/login" route anytime an HTTP response returns a 403 status code indicating that the user is no longer
                authenticated to the back-end service.</li>
                <li>Generate a generic error message visible in any Angular view whenever the HTTP response returns a 0 or 500 status code, indicating
                a communication issue with the server, and clear that error whenever a user switches views.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The demo version of the codebase provides scenarios to simulate some of these behaviors, one tied to login credentials used in the login
            view, the other tied to the detail link of the table on the main Sales view (further details are available in both views).</p>

            <p>For more information on HTTP interceptors in general, consult the Angular documentation:
            <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$http#interceptors" target="_blank">https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$http#interceptors</a></p>

            <h2><a name="authService"></a>Boilerplate authService Functions</h2>

            <p>The "template" codebase provides some boilerplate service functions in the app/services/authService.js file for interacting with the
            server via Angular's $http service to send and receive authentication and authorization data.  You should be able to use them in your
            application by simply providing the needed REST endpoint URLs.  The "demo" codebase uses the same functions with URLs that point
            to mocked endpoints defined in the mockRESTService.js file.</p>

            <p>One detail worth surfacing here is the use of the "withCredentials" option in the requestUser() function.  That setting, used by both the $http and $resource
            Angular services, needs to be set to "true" for any request where you want your application to send the authentication token cookie to the server to make
            an authenticated request for data.</p>

            <h2><a name="mockData"></a>Mocking REST Calls and REST Data</h2>

            <p>The $httpBackend service provided by the AngularJS ngMock module is primarily used to provide a fake response to HTTP calls made during unit tests.  However,
            it is also available in the ngMockE2E module (another module defined in the angular-mocks.js file) and can be used during end-to-end testing or to provide fake
            responses in an app not connected to real data, such as in the "demo" codebase.</p>

            <p>In the "demo" codebase, the mockServices module defined in the app/services/mockRESTService.js file is added as a dependency to the root module of the application
            in app/common/app.js, and the ngMockE2E module is itself is a dependency of the mockServices module.  So the mockRESTService.js file contains all of the mock data and
            the $httpBackend statements that intercept the calls made in the demo application and return the appropriate data.  It also contains a final $httpBackend statement
            that allows un-intercepted GET requests to pass through (resolve to the real URL), which is essential for allowing the calls to retrieve the view HTML through.</p>

            <h2><a name="protractorUserRoles"></a>Using Protractor with User Roles</h2>

            <p>The suggested tool for performing end-to-end (E2E) / browser interaction tests with AngularJS is <a href="http://angular.github.io/protractor/#/" target="_blank">Protractor</a>.
            This spark contains Protractor tests that execute against page objects: JavaScript objects that handle the task of interacting with the DOM elements in the browser you want to access 
            in your tests.  Storing these interactions in page objects rather than in the tests means you only have one file to update if the application pages are designed and the DOM elements 
            get renamed, relocated, or removed.</p>

            <p>Web applications where some pages and page elements are accessible to users with user role X, while other pages and page elements are accessible to users with
                user role Y provide a challenge when writing browser interaction tests, as the login process and the resulting authenticated user become parameters affecting
            the test. E2E tests tend to be slow to begin with:  having to go through the login process for each individual authenticated view adds to the execution time.</p>

            <p>The Protractor tests in this spark address this challenge.  The test files, located in the testing/e2e/testFiles folder, are split between "unauthenticated"
            and "authenticated" subfolders, and the "authenticated" folder contains subfolders for each user role.  This division of tests is then reflected in the "suites"
            setting of the Protractor configuration file (testing/config/protractor.conf.js).  When Protractor is instructed to execute one of these suites of tests, the onPrepare()
            function in the configuration file relays the name of the suite plus other information to the related PrepareObject in testing/e2e/helpers, receives back the
            appropriate login credentials and user metadata, and executes the login process.  The suite of tests is then executed with expectations based on the user credentials
            used for that suite.</p>

            <p>The Protractor tests in the "demo" codebase provide the best set of learning examples of this technique and of the tests and page objects, since the "template"
            codebase has no set user roles or role-specific views.</p>

            <h2><a name="gruntTasks"></a>Included Grunt Tasks</h2>

            <p>The <a href="http://gruntjs.com/" target="_blank">Grunt</a> tasks provided in this spark fall into two categories:  test execution tasks and file generation tasks.</p>

            <h3>Testing Tasks</h3>

            <p>The test execution tasks let you run the unit tests and Protractor tests from the command line, providing an easy means of executing a specific suite of Protractor tests
                as described in the earlier Protractor section.  It should be noted, however, that some IDEs like Webstorm and IntelliJ can be configured to execute these tests and report
                the results in a window in the IDE, which tends to result in more readable output.</p>

            <ul class="taskList">
                <li>

                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>File Generation Tasks</h3>

            <p>The file generation tasks provide commands for generating the starting skeletons for certain types of files that follow the coding syntax of the spark.  The tasks that
                generate the AngularJS files need to know the name of the root module (the value of the "ng-app" attribute used in the index.html file, and those tasks get that name
                from the "ngapp" setting in the grunt/sparkConfig.json file in this spark.  So make sure that setting value is in sync with the value of the "ng-app" attribute.  The
                template files that are copied and transformed by these tasks are located in the grunt/templates folder.</p>

            <ul class="taskList">
                <li>

                        <li>modules: If the test requires the loading of the controller and/or service modules, specify "controllers", "services", or "controllers,services".</li>

                    <p>Generates a new page object file in the Sparker testing/e2e/pageObjects folder. Options:</p>
                    <ul class="taskOptions">
                        <li>name: The name of the new page object file (required).  It will have ".js" appended to the end of the name.</li>
                        <li>route: The Angular route that pulls up the HTML containing the DOM elements the page object will interact with.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                    <p>Generates a new Protractor test file in the Sparker testing/e2e/testFiles folder based on the path provided. Options:</p>
                    <ul class="taskOptions">
                        <li>name: The name of the new test file (required).  It will have ".js" appended to the end of the name.</li>
                        <li>path: The location of the test file in the testFiles subfolder, based on which test suite it should belong to.  Defaults to "/" if not specified. The
                        supplied page also determines the relative path to the page objects folder, so relocating a test file means updating that relative path to the page object
                        in the test file.</li>
                        <li>pageObject: Name of the page object (minus the ".js" file extension) used by the test.  Must start with an uppercase letter (the page object filename is
                        expected to start with an uppercase letter).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
